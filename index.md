**Co-Founder, Architect**

> _Envision the great market opportunity for API solutions and bet on the emerging Node.js platform to accelerate digital transformation of business_

- Co-founded the startup to ride on the booming API economy by unleashing the power of Node.js platform for business-critical and mainstream use cases. Quickly established us as a thought-leader in the API and Node.js community. Successfully delivered products and services to gain tractions and be loved by developers. Acquired by IBM within 2.5 years for a great exit.

- Created the popular LoopBack framework - a first of its kind open source Node.js based API platform that facilitates developers to quickly build REST and other forms of open APIs in JavaScript by composing business logic that connect to existing databases, services, and infrastructure using the model driven approach. The LoopBack framework was a critical asset that led to IBM's acquisition of StrongLoop to expand its API lifecycle solutions. My Key contributions were:

  - Led the core architecture, design and developer experience
  - Implemented many key features, including but not limited to:
    - Models & JSON based language for modeling, query, and mutation
    - Datasources/Connectors
      - Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQL Server, …
      - REST, SOAP, gRPC
    - Access control
    - Middleware pipeline
    - Integration components
      - Push notification, Cloud storage, Passport security, oAuth2
    - CLI, StrongLoop Arc, and API Explorer

The Address Book service is rebuilt on REST & JSONRPC with the MongoDB store. Developed a migration tool and process to migrate millions of user contacts from Oracle into MongoDB without disruptions. The Address Verification and Tax Calculation services wrap 3rd party software stacks and make them highly performed and scalable. Established a role model of future projects migrating legacy functionality to the shared service platform (SSP).

  - Developed the Archive Service/API to support content/image uploads into Shutterfly using HTML 5 or mobile.

  - Drove the investigation into remoting a 3rd party e-commerce platform that consists of a set of Spring services tied to JPA persistence. Developed a reverse engineering tool to generate DTOs from JPA entities as well as Tuscany facade services that delegate to the Spring beans.

- Led the effort to adopt ELK platform the collect massive log data from all servers into an ElasticSearch cluster for searching and analytics.

- Continued to contribute to open source projects. Co-developed a Tuscany binding to support REST based JAX-RS. Enabled Tuscany integration with Spring Web and MVC.
